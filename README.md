This is a temporary repository for a group project.

Please note! You need to have a valid firebase app running-- start here: https://firebase.google.com/ and come back when you're ready

You'll need to generate a new web app from your firebase account and create a .env.local in your client directory. Fill in the appropriate items in your .env.local file such as "REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API", etc.

## How to install
* Clone this repository to your local file system.
* cd into the newly created directory
* run `npm install` or `npm i` to pull in all package dependencies
* run `npm start` which starts the express web server and serves up the react front end in the 'client' directory
